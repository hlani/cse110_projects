    I am a current third-year, majoring in computer science. As a programmer, I know a sufficient amount academically but in actual practice and the tech industry there are skills that I lack. Though, I hope to strengthen previous knowledge and acquire new skills. I am on the grind trying to pull an internship. Sometimes I get imposter syndrome but everyone goes at their own pace! 

a few things about me is that I like
- reading ðŸ“š
- rock climbing ðŸ§—
- playing video games
- photography ðŸ“¸
- food
